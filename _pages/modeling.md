## Bayesian Modeling

I utilized Bayesian modeling techniques to improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. This includes:

- Performing a Bayesian regression for global fitting of multiple types of biochemical and biophysical data and studying the dimerization and ligand binding of coronavirus main protease ([Paper in 2025](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495(25)00417-5))

- Applying Bayesian regression to quantify uncertainty in binding parameters from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, providing a more reliable analysis than traditional error propagation methods ([Paper in 2023](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/20/15074)).

- [Comparing Bayesian frameworks such as NumPyro, Pyro, and PyMC3 for analyzing ITC data](https://vanngocthuyla.github.io/posts/modeling/bitc-PPL-benchmark).

- Using Bayesian regression and model selection to study binding affinities in enantiomeric mixtures through ITC ([Paper in 2022](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273656)).


## Drug Design & Pharmacological Insights

My work in drug design focuses on improving data analysis methods for pharmacological screening. Key achievements include:

- Enhancing concentration-response curve fitting by incorporating control data, leading to more accurate estimates of half-maximal concentrations ([Paper in 2023](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c00107)).
