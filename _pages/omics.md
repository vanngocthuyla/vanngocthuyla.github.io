## Transcriptomic analysis

I analyze RNA-seq data to gain a deeper understanding of gene expression dynamics. My transcriptomic work includes:

- Profiling RNA transcripts under specific biological conditions or in particular cell types.

- Performing homology-based annotation to uncover the functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

- Identifying crucial markers for distinguishing cell subtypes.

- Quantifying gene expression to reveal insights into transcriptional regulation.


## Genomic analysis

I work on identifying genomic variations and abnormalities that drive diseases, particularly using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. Some of my key projects include:

- Detecting chromosomal anomalies in human WGS data for early diagnosis of genetic disorders.

- Pre-diagnosing breast cancer through copy number variant (CNV) detection using WES data.
