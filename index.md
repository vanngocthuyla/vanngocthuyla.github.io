## About Me

Welcome to my website! I am a computational biologist with a strong focus on molecular biology and chemical biology. I specialize in utilizing statistical models and machine learning, constructing analysis pipelines and workflows, and integrating complex data to bridge scientific knowledge gaps, drive research, and support practical applications.

I am currently conducting research at David Minh lab, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL.  I welcome inquiries and collaborations, and I am eager to engage in discussions about how computational biology can enhance research and product development for human health.

## Education

**Ph.D. in Biology** from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois.

**MSc in Biotechnology** and **BS in Biotechnology** from University of Science, VNUHCM.

## Research Areas

- Omics analysis: genomic analysis and variant calling; transcriptomic profiling and differential gene expression (DEG)

- Statistical analysis: Bayesian modeling and inference, uncertainty quantification

- Application of Machine Learning in biomedical research

I invite you to explore the details on the Publications and Projects page.
